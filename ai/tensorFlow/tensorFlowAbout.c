概念:

High Level APIs
    Keras
        TensorFlow is high-level API for building and training deep learning models.
        用来建立或者训练深度学习模型
    Eager Execution
        an API for writing TensorFlow code imperatively, like you would use Numpy.
        用来编写TensorFlow代码的语言，比如Python或者javascript
    Importing Data
        easy input pipelines to bring your data into your TensorFlow program.
        方便将训练使用的数据导入到自己的TensorFlow程序中去
    Estimators
        a high-level API that provides fully-packaged models ready for large-scale training and production.
        暂时理解为一个训练机器
